Introduction

The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the first to occur to use when we think about the nature of learning. When an infant plays, waves its arms, or looks about, it has no explicit teacher, but it does have a direct sensorimotor connection to its environment. Exercising this connection ..


1.1 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is learning what to do - how to map situations to actions - so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics - trial-and-error search and delayed reward - are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.

Reinforcement learning, like many topics whose names end with "ing", such as machine learning and mountaineering, is simultaneously a problem, a class of ...

A learning agent must be able to sense the state of its environment to some extent and must be able to take actions that affect the state. The agent also must have a goal or goals relating to the state of the environment.
